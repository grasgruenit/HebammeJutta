Austria, and is registered under number 1852 in the Austrian Midwives’ Register.
1.2. These Terms and Conditions govern the treatment agreement between Jutta Wehinger
(hereinafter referred to as the “Independent Midwife”) and the pregnant, birthing, or
postpartum client (hereinafter referred to as the “Client”) in the sense of a freelance service
contract.</p>
<p>Conclusion of Contract:
2.1. The treatment agreement between the Independent Midwife and the Client is concluded
following a paid initial consultation and the signing of the treatment agreement and the

reasonably expected.</p>
<p>Subject of the Contract:
3.1. The exact scope of services under the treatment agreement is defined in the service
catalogue agreed between the Independent Midwife and the Client.
3.2. The Independent Midwife is not generally bound to a specific location when providing

appointments take place.</p>
<p>Client’s Obligations:

nearest hospital or paediatrician.</p>
<p>4.7. Should the Independent Midwife not immediately respond to the Client’s first telephone

immediately, or at least four weeks in advance for planned absences.</p>

reasons by written notice, with immediate effect.

time without giving reasons, observing applicable duty of care obligations, but is not obliged

advice, provides inaccurate or incomplete information for assessment or diagnosis, or
obstructs therapeutic measures.
