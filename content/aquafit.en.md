Feel light, supported and energized as your pregnancy progresses. In the soothing
weightlessness of water, gentle movements keep you active without strain – ideal when your
bump is growing heavier. The water acts like a natural lymphatic massage, easing swelling in
hands and legs and leaving you refreshed.  
Water is life – we all begin in it, and your baby is already floating in the protective warmth of
amniotic fluid. In Aqua Fit, you’ll experience this natural element as a source of balance,
vitality and flowing energy – for both you and your baby.
