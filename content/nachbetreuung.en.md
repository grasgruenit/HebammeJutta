Postnatal support is where my heart truly lies. I love accompanying new parents through this
emotional stage of life, offering practical guidance, breastfeeding support and reassurance.
During each home visit I will:

* Weigh and check your baby (navel, sleep rhythm, care)
* Support you with breastfeeding and baby care
* Check your recovery: bleeding, milk supply, uterine involution, and overall wellbeing
* Give you time and space for all your questions

For environmental and time reasons, I offer home visits only in Dornbirn, Lustenau and  Hohenems â€“ but visits at my practice are always possible for everyone.
