Following my heart led me to my dream profession. From an early age, I felt a special
connection to babies and children. Helping new parents grow into their roles brings me joy
every day, especially when it presents new challenges – challenges I meet with passion,
warmth and dedication. This work makes me truly happy.
Since 2008, I have been teaching prenatal classes and pelvic floor training. In 2010 I began
offering baby massage courses, and since 2019 I have been supporting parents during the
postnatal period with home visits.

**Midwifery practice in Lustenau**
I share my practice with Natalie and Philipp Storf from Osteopathy and Physiotherapy Storf.
Natalie specialises in osteopathy for pregnant women and newborns, which makes our work
a perfect complement.
