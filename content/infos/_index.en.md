The greatest joy in my life are my husband and our two children, who are now almost grown
up. Through them, I have gained invaluable experiences and insights that continue to inspire
my work.

After completing my training at the Midwifery Academy in Innsbruck in 2004, I started
working in the delivery ward in Dornbirn. Like many young midwives, I first believed that birth
itself was the very heart of the profession. But after my maternity leave, I discovered that
good preparation for birth – and loving, competent support in the postnatal period – are just
as important.
