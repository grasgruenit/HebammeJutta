I consent to my provided data being processed in compliance with the GDPR for the purpose
of delivering midwifery services. If no services have yet been provided, this consent may be
withdrawn at any time. If services have already been rendered, the data will only be used to
document and demonstrate the correct provision of previous services (e.g., midwifery
records, billing). Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of any data processing
carried out based on the consent prior to its withdrawal.

Your data will be irreversibly deleted after the expiry of the statutory retention periods for
documentation and billing (30 years for home births, 10 years in all other cases). We do
not share your data without your consent, except where required by law, such as for billing
purposes.

I, the midwife, process your data in accordance with applicable data protection regulations.

You have the following rights in principle: access, rectification, deletion, restriction of
processing, data portability, withdrawal of consent, and objection. If you believe that the
processing of your data violates data protection law, or if your data protection rights have
otherwise been infringed, you may lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. In
Austria, this is the Data Protection Authority.
