(Currently in training â€“ available on request for certain treatments, such as birth preparation.)

Acupuncture offers a gentle, side-effect-free way to ease pregnancy discomforts, and can be
ideally combined with conventional medicine. I also offer other Traditional Chinese Medicine
methods such as cupping, cupping massage, moxa and gua sha.
Acupuncture during pregnancy and after birth can support with:

* Nausea
* Back pain, sciatica
* Breech position (to encourage baby to turn)
* Headaches and migraines
* Birth preparation
* Induction, after the due date
* Breastfeeding difficulties
